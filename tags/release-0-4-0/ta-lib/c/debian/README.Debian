ta-lib for Debian
-----------------

Build the Debian binary packages from the tags/release-0-4-0/ta-lib/c
directory. Make sure that you prepare auto-configure and
auto-make. After cloning from Git, type:

	sh autogen.sh
	dpkg-buildpackage -b

The *.deb packages for ta-lib and ta-lib-dev will appear in
tags/release-0-4-0/ta-lib, the parent directory.
